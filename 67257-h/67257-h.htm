  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>In the pages of this Manual an attempt is made
to give full and practical instruction in Sabre
and Singlestick Play, and in the use of Sabre
against Bayonet, and also to explain the course of
practice that is necessary for those who wish to
perform the difficult sword feats which require at
once strength and lightness of hand. How far I
have succeeded in what I have sought to do it will
be for the readers of these pages to judge; but I
may perhaps be permitted to say that the book
which I now venture to offer to the public is the
result of experience in the use of arms extending
over an unusually long period, and that before I
began to teach, some twenty years ago, I was so
fortunate as to be trained by teachers of the
highest skill. I learnt fencing from the late
M. Prevost, Fencing-Master to H.R.H. the Prince
of Wales, and to the Royal Family of France, and,
as pupil and assistant, practised for many years
with this admirable master of the small sword,
who in his prime had been certainly one of the best
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>fencers, perhaps the best, fencer in Paris. To make
me as thorough a proficient with the weapon as
he was himself, my esteemed friend spared no
pains. In the use of the sabre and singlestick I
was first trained by Mr. Platts, who had learnt
from the celebrated Bushman his system of broadsword
play. I thus had the advantage of learning
from those best qualified to teach; but when, after
no short or easy period of probation, I became in
my turn an instructor, and gained that knowledge
which can only be gained by teaching and by
constant combat with adversaries of all degrees of
strength, it appeared to me that that part of the
course I had gone through had been somewhat
conventional, and though the system of fencing
which I had learnt from Prevost could scarcely
be altered for the better, the English method of
sabre play, good as it was, could be considerably
improved. Sabre-players, as a rule, have not been
fencers, or at least have been fencers of trifling
skill. Accomplished fencers have usually, from
an exaggerated fear of losing their lightness of
hand, not cared to work much with the sabre.
The consequence has been that no attempt has
been made to bring knowledge of the small sword
to bear upon sabre play, and that little attention
has been given to what is really the most formidable
way of handling the latter weapon. Those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>who have taught its use seem to have thought of
little else than the cuts which can be given with
it, and to have overlooked the fact that the modern
sabre, essentially a cut-and-thrust weapon, can be
used with great effect for thrusts, and that, when
thrusting, a man exposes himself less and is more
likely to disable his antagonist than when he
delivers a cut. It is true that one or two thrusts
have been taught, but small reliance has been
placed in them, and several of the fencer’s methods
of attack and defence which are admirably suited
for sword play have been altogether neglected.</p>

<p class='c009'>Daily combats gave me every opportunity for
putting my ideas to the rough test of practice,
and I soon found that I was not mistaken, and
that there were longes and time thrusts which
could be delivered with the sword, and were
formidable even to the most skilled opponents. I
made it, therefore, part of my work as a teacher
and sabre player to improve sabre play by adapting
to it many movements used in fencing which
have hitherto been entirely overlooked by sabre
players, and also by copying the fencer to make
the attacks, &amp;c., in a closer and consequently
quicker and more effective manner than they had
before been made.</p>

<p class='c009'>These movements are specially described in
this manual.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>That the man who has mastered them will
have a more varied and effective manner of
using his weapon than one who has only
practised the ordinary method, and will therefore
be a far more formidable antagonist, will, I
think, be admitted by all who, possessing some
knowledge of the subject, do me the honour of
giving attention to these pages; and inasmuch as
sabre practice is not a mere exercise, but a course
of training which teaches a man how to defend his
life, it is scarcely necessary to point out that a really
efficacious and not traditional method of using the
weapon should be adopted. Recent events have
shown our soldiers that even in these days of
“arms of precision” the sword is not by any
means obsolete. Assuredly these men should be
taught to handle it in the best way. A soldier’s
life may often depend on his being able to wield his
sword against a determined antagonist, and his
chances of victory are not likely to be improved
by the fact that his instructors have forgotten that
a sabre has a point as well as an edge, and have
not taught him the most formidable way of using
the weapon they have placed in his hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is true that to many of those who learn how
to handle the sabre this matter is not of much
importance, inasmuch as what they seek is a
healthy and interesting exercise, and as they are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>not likely to have to wield the weapon in the
defence of their lives. Considered, however,
merely as an amusement and an exercise, sabre
play is better when the conditions of the actual
combat are followed as closely as possible in the
mimic fight. It is more interesting and seems
more real and practical, while the many varied
movements which are required when every possible
way of handling the sword is resorted to
strengthen the whole frame as no other exercise
can. I am not without hope that the altered
system of sword play I have described in this
Manual will, if properly followed, be found
interesting by amateurs as well as by soldiers,
and I am greatly encouraged in this hope by the
fact that the very numerous pupils I have had the
honour of instructing have never failed to take
great interest in what they had to learn and
practise: have often been as anxious to acquire
complete mastery over the weapon as if they were
shortly to use it in actual fight, and, in not a few
cases, have attained exceptional proficiency. I
would add that, while greatly changing the
method of using the point in sabre play, I have
been careful to retain all that was good in the
old system, and have described minutely and to
the best of my ability the established cuts and
guards.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>In these chapters I have written nothing special
on Singlestick, as the stick is merely a substitute
for the sabre, and is used exactly in the same
manner, and throughout the Manual everything
said about sword play applies equally to singlestick
play.</p>

<p class='c009'>On contests with sword against bayonet, nothing,
so far as I am aware, has yet been written, and as
the knowledge of how to use one weapon against
another cannot but be of the greatest value to the
soldier, I have endeavoured to put into the most
practical form what I have learnt from observation
of assaults innumerable, and from many hard
struggles against vigorous antagonists.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sword feats are of less importance than skill in
the defensive and offensive use of the weapon, but
when well performed are always greatly admired;
and I have frequently found that good swordsmen
were anxious to learn how to execute them. I
have therefore carefully described the manner of
accomplishing a variety of these <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tours de force</span></i>.
Some of these, such as—</p>

<p class='c010'>Cutting a sheep in two at one stroke, and</p>

<p class='c010'>Cutting an apple in a handkerchief without
injuring the latter,</p>

<p class='c011'>Are of my own invention, and I venture to say
with confidence that any one possessed of a fair
amount of strength, and accustomed to the use of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>the weapon, will be able, after some practice, to
perform all the sword feats which are mentioned.</p>

<p class='c009'>In conclusion, I trust I may be allowed, not in
the usual formal manner, but as an assurance of
respectful regard, to dedicate this little book to
my pupils, whose attention and intelligence have
yielded me unceasing encouragement, and to
whose kind suggestion that I should put my
system of instruction into a written form, these
pages are due.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>HOW TO HOLD A SABRE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>In holding a light sabre, place the fingers round
the grip so that the middle knuckles are in a
line with the edge, and let the thumb lie on the
back to enable you to direct the point.</p>

<p class='c009'>With a heavy sabre, the thumb should be placed
round the grip, or you maybe disarmed by a strong
beat made with a sword of the same weight.</p>

<p class='c009'>In singlestick, do not let the end of the thumb
touch the hilt, or a hard blow on the hilt might
seriously injure it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hold the sword securely, but do not grasp it
tightly, or your hand and arm will soon tire. The
grasp should only be tightened when delivering a
cut or forming a guard.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is great art in easing the grip directly
after a movement has been executed. A swordsman
who does this properly has what is termed
“a soft hand,” a great desideratum in sword play.
It gives quickness to the hand, and saves it from
being jarred.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>PLATE I.<br /> <span class='c017'><span class='sc'>Preliminary Position before going on Guard.</span></span></h3>

<p class='c018'>Turn the left foot to the left, and place the right
in front of it, so that the back of the right heel
touches the inside of the left. The feet will then
be at right angles. Easing the grip, let the back
of the sword rest in the hollow of the right shoulder,
the sword-elbow touching the right hip, and the
hand in a direct line in front of it. Close the left
hand, and place it on the back of the left hip (so
that it cannot be seen from the front), with the
elbow thrown back.</p>

<p class='c009'>Body half turned to the left, face full to the
front.</p>

  <h3 class='c019'>PLATE II.<br /> <span class='c017'><span class='sc'>Engaging Guard.</span></span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Move the sword-arm to the front until the hand
is directly opposite the hollow of the right shoulder,
bend the elbow slightly and raise it, sink the wrist,
and turn up the middle knuckles and edge of the
sword. Advance, and lower the point until it is
nearly opposite and level with the left hip.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then advance the right foot about twice its own
length straight to the front, and at the same time
bend both knees <em>well</em>. Keep the body and head
upright, and divide their weight equally between
both legs, with the loins well pressed in.</p>

<p class='c009'>When this guard is properly formed, the upper
knuckles and elbow are level and in line with the
shoulder. It is called <em>High Seconde</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>On crossing swords, which should be about nine
inches from each other’s point, when it is called
an equal engagement, press your blade gently
upon that of your adversary, so as to close the line
in which you are engaged. By this means you
are protected from a straight thrust.</p>

<p class='c009'>I prefer this Engaging Guard to any other for
the following reasons:—</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>That when properly formed, it protects the arm
and body from all cuts, and the sword is in the
best position to defend the head and leg, which
may be done by merely raising and lowering the
hand. In other guards you have to turn the point
down in addition to doing so.</p>

<p class='c009'>Simply raising or lowering the hand will also
parry the thrusts, however high or low or at whatever
part they may be aimed. Tierce and quarte,
which are the other engaging guards usually taken,
only defend the right and left breasts.</p>

<p class='c009'>The hand and point are also better placed in it
than in other guards for giving the stop thrusts and
time thrusts by opposition, and all attacks except
those directed at the head.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Engaging Guard with the point up is, however,
preferred and taken by some sabre players.
It is called outside guard or <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tierce</span></i> when the hand
is on the right, and inside guard or <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">quarte</span></i> when
on the left side of the body. In each of these
guards one side of the arm is exposed, and for that
and the above-named reasons I do not like either
of them so well as the one with the point down
(<em>high seconde</em>).</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>To form the Inside Guard or Quarte.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Place the right elbow about eight inches in front
of the centre of the right breast, with the hand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>advanced and to the left. Pommel of the sword
opposite the left nipple. The point as high as, and
about two or three inches to the right (his right)
of your adversary’s right eye. Edge slightly
turned to your left.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>To form the Outside Guard or Tierce.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Move the hand about six or seven inches to the
right without shifting the upper arm, which should
be kept near the side, and slightly turn the palm
down. Edge to the right. Point about two or
three inches to the left (his left) of your adversary’s
left eye. Hand and point the same height as in
Inside Guard.</p>

<p class='c009'>These guards may be used as parries with good
effect against a bayonet or lance.</p>

<p class='c009'>An Engaging Guard formed in the manner
above described is called “Defensive,” as it covers
the side on which you are engaged, and defends it
from a straight thrust.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is called “Offensive” when the arm is more
straightened and the point directed to your adversary,
so that the line in which you are engaged is
open.</p>

<p class='c009'>After engaging, you are not bound to remain
with the blades touching, but it is an advantage
to do so to a man who possesses a light hand and
has a fine feel of the blade.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>The feel of the blade often telegraphs to you
your adversary’s intention. By it you can tell if
he is going to attack, or you may learn what guard
he will form on the first movement of your attack
upon him.</p>

<p class='c009'>To obtain a proper feel of the blade, you should
not grasp your sword tightly, but gently press the
tips of your fingers on the grip, and keep as light
a touch of your adversary’s blade as possible.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>To Advance.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Move the right foot about six inches forward,
letting the heel touch the ground first, then let the
left foot follow it the same distance.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>To Retire.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Move the left foot back about six inches, and let
the right follow it the same distance.</p>

<p class='c009'>In advancing or retiring, keep the head and
body erect and perfectly steady, with the knees
well bent.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>To Attack.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Stretch the sword-arm to its full length as
quickly as possible on a level with the shoulder,
without stiffness or jerking or any preliminary
movement, and direct the edge or point of your
sword to the part you wish to hit. Raise the toes
of the right foot, and step straight to the front,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>until the feet are about four times the length of
your foot apart; let the heel touch the ground
first.</p>

<p class='c009'>As you raise the foot to longe<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c020'><sup>[1]</sup></a> press in the left
haunch and straighten the left leg, keeping the
left foot firmly fixed on the ground. In longeing,
let the right heel almost touch the ground.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. Pressing in the left haunch when longeing adds considerable
quickness to the attack, it also causes the body
to be upright on the completion of the longe, and therefore
enables a man to recover to the guard with less effort
and greater quickness.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>On the completion of the longe the body and
head should be erect, the shoulders have their
natural fall, and the right knee be perpendicular to
the instep, left leg straight, and foot flat and firm
on the ground, and the weight of the body equally
divided between the haunches. The whole of these
movements should be performed <em>together</em> with the
greatest rapidity.</p>

<p class='c009'>Be careful not to give any sign of preparation,
but make the attack with great boldness and
suddenness.</p>

<p class='c009'>Do not raise the hand, or draw it or the point
of the sword back when about to deliver an attack;
by so doing you expose your arm to a time cut
and the body to a time thrust.</p>

<p class='c009'>In attacking, never let the foot touch the ground
before the sword reaches its destination.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>In all attacks and returns the point of the sword
should travel over no more space than is necessary
for it to arrive at its intended destination.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>To Recover.</span></p>

<p class='c009'>Draw back the arm and foot, and bending the
left knee, resume the position of Guard, with knees
well bent.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Opposition.</span></p>

<p class='c009'>Is to oppose your sword to that of your adversary
when cutting or thrusting, either in an attack
or return, so as to prevent him from touching you,
at the same time in the same line, with a counter.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus if you deliver a cut on the left side of his
head, bear your hand to your own left until it is
as high as, and about four inches to the left of,
your eye; the left side of your head will then be
guarded.</p>

<p class='c009'>In like manner, always cover with the forte of
your sword the part of your own person which
corresponds with the part you are attacking.</p>

<p class='c009'>While cutting at your adversary’s left side or
thrusting with your palm turned up in <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">quarte</span></i>,
your hand should be opposite your left shoulder.
While cutting at his right side or thrusting with
the palm turned down in <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tierce</span></i>, your hand should
be opposite your right shoulder.</p>

<p class='c009'>The elevation of the hand depends on where the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>attack is made, but it ought rarely to be below the
shoulder, except when cutting at the leg.</p>

<p class='c009'>Against a man who counters on the head, the
hand should be kept as high as your own eye.</p>

<p class='c009'>If you neglect your opposition you are liable to
be both guarded and hit at the same time by a
man who counters with good opposition.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>
  <h3 class='c019'>PLATE III.<br /> <span class='c017'><span class='sc'>Feinting.</span></span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c018'>A feint is a threatened attack made to induce
your adversary to guard one part while you
deliver the real attack on another. It is made
by suddenly straightening the arm, without any
movement of the body or feet, and directing the
point at the place you wish him to guard.</p>

<p class='c009'>Feints are also made to find out a man’s method
of defence and general style of play; when done
for that purpose you should watch carefully what
he does, and instantly return to your guard, but
when it is your intention to follow up the feint
with an attack the cut should follow the feint with
the greatest rapidity.</p>

<p class='c009'>An attack preceded by a feint is done thus:
Make the feint as directed above, then longe, and
by a quick and close action of the wrist, deliver the
real attack, taking care not to draw back the hand
as you do so.</p>

<p class='c009'>This is called “Deceiving a Guard.”</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Guards.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>All guards should be made with the edge of the
forte of the sword, that is, the half of the blade
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>next to the hand (the other half is called the feeble),
and with the wrist well sunk. A firm guard is
thus formed, and consequently a quick return can
be given.</p>

<p class='c009'>Too much force should not be used, so that a
second guard may be readily made should the first
be deceived. The sword should never be moved
one inch more than is necessary to defend the part
attacked.</p>

<p class='c009'>I prefer the cuts on the left side of the head, for
the reasons that the extra turn of the wrist necessary
for their execution adds considerable force to
them, and that when the opposition is correctly
formed the whole of the head is defended from a
counter, which is not the case when the cuts are
delivered on the right side. Then the opposition
only covers that side of the head. This I think to
be of great importance, as the head, as a rule, is
the part at which men naturally and generally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>counter. The vertical is not an effective one. A
downward cut on the top of a man’s head protected
by a helmet would not do him much harm.</p>

<p class='c009'>In making the horizontal or diagonal cut at the
right side of the head, a man may be timed if his
adversary, instead of guarding, gives a straight
thrust with his hand opposite his right eye as the
attack is being made. The opposition thus formed
would guard the attack. This cannot be done on
the cuts at the left side of the head, as there is no
certain opposition on that side.</p>

<p class='c009'>The diagonal cut at the left side of the head
should be aimed at the temple in such a direction
that, should the sword pass through, it would come
out near the right angle of the jaw.<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c020'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>It should be made with the wrist, and delivered
in the manner described in page <a href='#Page_22'>22</a> (To Attack).</p>

<p class='c009'>Be careful as you longe to bear your hand to

is as high as, and a little to the left of, your left eye
and look over your forearm.</p>

<p class='c018'>Raise the hand until it is opposite the right
temple, with the upper knuckles level with the top

the sword without lowering the chin. Point well
advanced, and nearly opposite to the left elbow, so
as to cover the left cheek and breast. Edge upwards.
Arm slightly bent, with elbow turned up
and hidden behind the hilt.</p>

<p class='c009'>A short man should form this guard a little
higher than the right temple.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Feint a Straight Thrust at the Breast, and Cut at the Head.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Feint a straight thrust at your adversary’s
breast under his blade, by suddenly straightening
the arm, with the hand as high as the shoulder,
and hilt turned upwards to protect the arm from a
time cut; then, without lowering the hand or
drawing back the point, longe and deliver the
diagonal cut on the left temple.</p>

<p class='c009'>This attack is sometimes made by feinting at
the outside of the leg instead of at the breast. It
is not, however, so safe, as you expose the arm to
a time cut while making it.</p>

<p class='c009'>None of the three preceding attacks can be made

guard the left cheek and wrist, and the engaging

against these parts.</p>

<p class='c009'>The guard with the point up ought only to be
used as an auxiliary, when you find that your point
in forming the other guard has got too high.</p>

<p class='c018'>Feint at outside of leg, and as your adversary
tries to counter, make a half longe, and, aiming at
the inside of his wrist, make a retrograde cut by
drawing your hand towards your body, and at the
same time retire out of distance.</p>

<p class='c009'>Attacks at the leg should never be made without
being preceded by a feint or a beat to divert your
adversary’s attention, and even when done in that
manner you should be chary of their use. The
man on the defensive has the advantage of either
guarding and returning or shifting and countering,
and should he adopt the latter method and not shift
his leg quickly enough to avoid the hit, he would
have considerably the better of the exchange.</p>

<p class='c009'>I do not, however, think that attacks at the leg
should be entirely ignored, neither do I think that
they should always be avoided by shifting the leg.
A man on horseback cannot do so. Both methods
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>of defence should be practised. A man who relies
entirely upon shifting may easily be drawn into a
trap, as is shown in Plates XIII. and XIV. When

<h4 class='c016'>STRAIGHT THRUST.</h4>

<p class='c018'>When on guard, the point of your sword is under
the forte of your adversary’s, and a straight thrust
may be given should he quit the engagement, by
suddenly straightening the arm and directing the
point at his breast; deliver it with a longe.</p>

<p class='c009'>A good time to make this thrust is when he prepares
for his attack or dwells on his feint at your
head, or when he advances, as described in page <a href='#Page_59'>59</a>.</p>

<p class='c009'>The guard for the straight thrust is the same as
that used for guarding the outside of the leg.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Thrust by Disengaging over the Blade</span>.</h5>

<p class='c018'>This is given in the same manner and under the
same circumstances as the straight thrust, except
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>that you pass the point of your sword over the
forte of your adversary’s.</p>

<p class='c009'>These thrusts may be given either with the palm
of the hand turned down in tierce, when the hand
should be opposite to your right shoulder, or with
the palm turned up in quarte, when the hand
should be opposite your left shoulder.</p>

<p class='c009'>In both thrusts the edge of the sword should be
well turned up, so that the hand and arm are
covered by the hilt, and the point brought in line
with the adversary’s breast.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the point touches, the hand should rise and
the grip of the sword be slightly eased, the arm
kept perfectly straight and well stretched.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is dangerous to thrust when practising with
sabres, unless you are well protected with pads;
but with sticks the point should be freely used,
always, however, taking care to ease the grip as
the point touches, so that your hand may slip a
little up the stick, and by that means avoid giving
your adversary an unpleasant prod.</p>

<p class='c009'>The guard for the thrust over the blade is the
same as that used for guarding the head.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Feint a Straight Thrust and Disengage over the Blade.</span></h5>

<p class='c018'>Straighten your arm and threaten a straight
thrust, and without bending the arm or drawing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>it back, disengage over the blade and deliver the
thrust with a longe.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><span class='sc'>To Guard this Attack.</span></h5>

<p class='c018'>Form the outside leg guard, and then the head
guard, as quickly, lightly, and closely as possible.</p>

<h5 class='c016'>“<span class='sc'>One, Two.</span>”</h5>

<p class='c018'>Pass your point over your adversary’s blade,
and with a straight arm threaten a thrust, then,
instantly, without bending the arm or drawing it
back, pass your point under his sword and deliver
a thrust with a longe.</p>

<p class='c009'>To guard this attack, form the head guard and
then the outside leg guard.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Attacks made with an Advance.</span></h5>

<p class='c018'>All the attacks can be preceded by an advance.
When so done, the movement should be covered
with a beat either under or over the adversary’s
blade, to prevent a stop thrust being given. The
beat should be made very closely with the thumb
and forefinger, and both it and the feint should be
done while advancing, and the cut or thrust given
with the longe.<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c020'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r3'>3</a>. The beat may also be used with great advantage in
attacks not preceded by an advance. It should be made
when a counter is expected, which it would most probably
prevent, and should occasionally be used to check the
adversary’s parry.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>In the advance and longe the right foot moves
twice and the left once. They should move as
quickly as it is possible to count “One, two, three.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A short man ought to use this method of attack
when opposed to a tall man, as otherwise he cannot
reach him. He should advance very rapidly,
with short steps, and be prepared to parry as he
goes forward should his beat be deceived.</p>

<p class='c009'>A tall man ought seldom or never to advance
when attacking.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>RETURNS.</h4>

<p class='c018'>Returns should be made with a longe with the
greatest rapidity after guarding. Great care must
be taken not to draw back the hand or point before
making them.</p>

<p class='c009'>They should, as a rule, be made direct, but may
sometimes be preceded by a feint, and should be
very much varied.</p>

<p class='c009'>The best returns from the different guards are
the following, placed in the order of their comparative
merits, that is, the first is a better return
than the second, and so on; but their application
should depend a great deal on your adversary’s
defence:—</p>

His blow will fall harmlessly, and the effect of yours will

<h4 class='c016'>REPRISE ATTACK.</h4>

<p class='c018'>A reprise is a sudden repetition of the attack,

get away out of distance.</p>

<p class='c009'>In using the stop thrusts, remises, and time
thrusts, great judgment is required. They should
never be attempted until the swordsman has had
considerable experience. When given at the proper
time, they are beautiful and effective strokes, but
when badly timed, great danger attends their use,
and mutual hitting is often the result.</p>

<p class='c009'>Young players will do well not to attempt them.</p>

<p class='c009'>In an assault, should you find yourself timed
and not know how to draw and stop a time thrust,
your safest plan will be to make direct attacks only,
that is, attacks not preceded by a feint.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>
  <h4 class='c016'>DRAWING.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Is to induce your adversary to deliver a certain
cut or thrust for which you are prepared. To
do this, make a false attack, that is, attack with a
half longe so that you can the more readily recover
and guard; thus, having drawn out and guarded
his cut, instantly deliver a genuine one.</p>

<p class='c009'>To prevent this being done upon you, draw back
your hand as your adversary makes his false
attack, and thus avoiding his sword, deliver a cut
on his head with a longe (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vide</span></i> Plate <a href='#XVII'>XVII</a>.).</p>

<h4 class='c016'>OBSERVATIONS ON FEINTING.</h4>

<p class='c018'>When a man makes a feint on you and you
foresee his intention, do not answer it, but wait
and parry his last movement. When acting on
this principle, take care he does not make a direct
attack, for should he do so, you will be too late,
as his arm would be straight before you have
moved.</p>

<p class='c009'>If you answer a feint, form your first guard as
lightly and as correctly as possible, so that you
have time to make a second one.</p>

<p class='c009'>By not forming the first correctly, your adversary,
taking advantage of your fault, would be
able to hit you when otherwise he could not. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>hits shown in Plates V., VI., and VII. are got
through this cause.</p>

<p class='c009'>When you are in doubt about his intentions,
step back out of distance on his first movement.</p>

<p class='c009'>When a man will not answer your feints, make
them with greater energy and rapidity, and thus
force him to do so.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><span class='sc'>How to Deal with a Man who is Continually Countering.</span></h5>

<p class='c018'>When you meet with a man who is guilty of
this very bad practice, you should deal with him
in the following ways:—</p>

<p class='c009'>Either act on the defensive and let him lead off,
then after guarding, return as quickly as possible
and get away.</p>

<p class='c009'>Or, make false attacks, and thus draw out his
counters, which guard, and then returning with
great quickness, get away.</p>

<p class='c009'>Or, by opposition, when, should his counters
be directed at your head or left side, lead off
without feinting with good opposition (in fact
your opposition should be slightly exaggerated)
at the part of his person which will correspond
with that of your own at which you think he will
aim his counter.</p>

<p class='c009'>If his counters are directed at your right side,
attack him with a straight thrust with your hand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>as high as, and a little to the right of, your right
shoulder. Palm turned down.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><span class='sc'>When Opposed to a Man who Engages in Quarte or Tierce.</span></h5>

<p class='c018'>When opposed to a man who engages in quarte
or tierce, you will find that he will guard his right
cheek and side with tierce, and his left side with
quarte. You may then make the following
attacks in addition to those already shown:—</p>

<h6 class='c016'><em>From the Engagement of Tierce.</em></h6>

<p class='c018'>Cut at the inside of his wrist.</p>

<p class='c009'>Feint inside the wrist and cut at the outside.</p>

<p class='c009'>Feint at the left cheek and cut at the right.</p>

<p class='c009'>Feint at the left breast and cut at the right side
or at his forearm.</p>

<h6 class='c016'><em>From the Engagement of Quarte.</em></h6>

<p class='c018'>Cut at the outside of his wrist.</p>

<p class='c009'>Feint outside the wrist and cut at the inside.</p>

<p class='c009'>Feint at the right cheek and cut at the left.</p>

<p class='c009'>Feint at the right side and cut at the left.</p>

<p class='c009'>His stop thrust should be avoided in the
following manner:—</p>

<p class='c009'>To prevent him from giving you a straight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>thrust as you advance to attack, beat his blade
either in tierce or quarte.</p>

<p class='c009'>Should he avoid the beat by disengaging and
thrust upon you, make a beat before you move
the feet, then, as you advance, change quickly
and beat on the other side of his blade, and
instantly deliver your attack.</p>

<p class='c009'>The beat will probably draw his disengagement,
and the change will parry it.</p>

<p class='c009'>To change is to pass your sword under that of
your adversary, and rejoin the blades on the
opposite line.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>OBSERVATIONS.<br /> <span class='sc'>On Countering and Hard-Hitting.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>When you are making an assault with sabres
or sticks, remember they are substitutes for sharp
swords, and act as though every hit you would
receive would either kill or disable you. All your
movements must be governed by this idea. You
should never attempt to do anything with a stick
that you could or would not do with a sword.</p>

<p class='c009'>You must remember that in an actual combat
the sabres have sharp points and edges, and that a
very light touch would probably place you <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors de
combat</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hitting at your adversary when he is attacking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>you is almost as bad as cutting your own throat,
for you are almost certain to be more or less
seriously wounded; your chances of escape are
very small indeed. You must, therefore, always
endeavour to guard the attack and never counter
except when you can avoid the hit by shifting.</p>

<p class='c009'>You must never hit after you are hit, as it is
very doubtful if you would be able to do so with
sharp swords.</p>

<p class='c009'>The act of countering, so deservedly popular
among boxers, is not admissible here. A blow
with the fist will probably only shake you, but
with a sharp sword the effect would be much more
serious. There is no such thing as give and take
with that weapon, and I question if there is much
in a serious encounter with sticks, as a well
delivered blow on any part of the head would in
all probability cause a cessation of hostilities.</p>

<p class='c009'>Rough and heavy hitting should be avoided: it
destroys quickness; greater effect is given to a
hit by pace than by force.</p>

<p class='c009'>A hard hitter has to brace himself together
before attacking; he thus prepares, and while
doing so may easily be hit.</p>

<p class='c009'>If his attack is guarded, he cannot recover and
guard a return so readily as he ought to do.</p>

<p class='c009'>His returns are not given so quickly as they
should be, for after guarding, he is almost certain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>to draw his hand back in order to make them with
greater force.</p>

<p class='c009'>As he hits, so he will guard; heaviness will
pervade all his movements; therefore, if you
deceive his guard, he cannot make a second one
with sufficient quickness to stop a good attack, as
he will throw too much force into the first.</p>

<p class='c009'>Slowness is the natural result of heaviness,
quickness that of lightness; therefore, if you wish
to become a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon tireur</span></i>, cultivate and practise light
play.</p>

<p class='c009'>In trying to play light, you must not get into
the habit of making snatching hits by which you
would only scratch your adversary. However
lightly you deliver them, let them be so given
that with a sharp sword they would be effective,
and your points fixed so that they would penetrate.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>CUT <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">versus</span></i> THRUST.</h4>

<p class='c018'>Some writers on the sword, acting on the presumption
that the sword must be elevated in
order to gain force before cutting, have asserted
that the point traverses two-thirds less distance
when thrusting than when cutting. If this were
correct, the less use made of the cut the better, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>a good swordsman would most certainly give a
time cut on the arm or deliver a thrust on a man
while he was thus preparing to cut.</p>

<p class='c009'>I once saw a sketch drawn to prove this assertion,
in which the man thrusting was depicted
with his point lowered to a line with his adversary’s
breast instead of being level with his eye,
while the man who was cutting, and should have
had his sword similarly placed, had his point
drawn back and raised about two feet above his
head, a distance greater than I should draw the
point of my sword back were I going to cut the
carcase of a sheep in two at one stroke.</p>

<p class='c009'>The point should not be drawn back or elevated
when cutting either in an attack or in a return.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is only one direct cut in leading off (that
at the head), and that can be given with quite
sufficient force without the slightest elevation
of the point if the sword arm and leg act
together.</p>

<p class='c009'>In all other attacks and returns the feint, or the
act of forming the guard, gives great impetus to
the cut.</p>

<p class='c009'>It has also been asserted that in making a
thrust the sword moves in a straight line, and in
making a cut it moves in a circle.</p>

<p class='c009'>This assertion is erroneous, and having been
made without contradiction, has been generally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>accepted as a fact, and hence become a popular
error.</p>

<p class='c009'>All straight thrusts and disengagements move
in straight lines, but in the cut over, the point
has to be drawn back before the thrust can be
given, and when a cut over is made after a parry,
the point traverses as great if not a greater distance
than in any cut.</p>

<p class='c009'>Compare the following movements, which I
think are the longest made either in thrusting or
cutting.</p>

<p class='c009'>Engage with foils in quarte and parry the disengagement
into tierce with prime, and riposte
with a cut over.</p>

<p class='c009'>Engage with sabres in high seconde, and,
guarding an attack at the head with prime, return
at the inside of the leg.</p>

<p class='c009'>All direct cuts at the right side on any part
from head to foot, from whatever guards they are
made, move in as straight lines as any thrusts
that can be given, and are consequently as quick.</p>

<p class='c009'>In all other cuts the point moves in a circle.</p>

<p class='c009'>However partial one may be to the thrust, and
I acknowledge that I am one of its partisans,
justice should be given to the cut, and although it
may not in every instance be so quick or so fatal
in its effect as the thrust, it has its advantages.
Among others, it rarely passes, that is, goes by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>object aimed at, without touching it, as the thrust
will often do, more particularly when aimed at the
arm or leg.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>USEFUL HINTS.</h4>

<p class='c018'>Immediately you go on guard, touch your
adversary’s sword with yours, and retire out of
distance to avoid a surprise. This is called
“engaging.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Keep your eyes open and fixed upon your
adversary, watching all his movements.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hold yourself in as easy a manner as possible,
particularly the sword arm.</p>

<p class='c009'>Keep your knees well bent while setting to;
you cannot longe quickly unless you do.</p>

<p class='c009'>Move the feet lightly, and never drag them on
the ground.</p>

<p class='c009'>Be careful to always keep sufficient room behind
you to be able to retire. Should your adversary
try to drive you back, either attack him or
threaten an attack.</p>

<p class='c009'>While manœuvring, keep out of reach, and plan
your attacks and deliver them immediately you
are within distance, then recover to the position of
guard whether you have succeeded or not.</p>

<p class='c009'>Should your adversary guard your attack and
return, form the necessary guard, and make a
second attack without the slightest delay.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>Do not hit at the same place more than twice
in succession, but vary your attacks and returns
very much.</p>

<p class='c009'>After two or three exchanges, break away out of
distance to steady yourself and plan your next
movements. In making long phrases you get
slow and out of form, and, consequently, are not
likely to get a hit.</p>

<p class='c009'>Always deliver your cuts with a true edge and
with the centre of percussion, which is generally
about seven or eight inches from the point. It is
the most effective part of the sword to cut with,
and will not jar the arm like a cut made with any
other part of the blade.</p>

<p class='c009'>Never press upon your adversary’s blade after
having delivered a cut or thrust, but recover as
quickly as possible to guard the return. Should
he press upon yours, disengage and return as
quickly as possible.</p>

<p class='c009'>Make all your cuts with the wrist; never throw
your arm out of line, but always keep it in front
of you.</p>

<p class='c009'>The action of cutting at your opponent’s left
side (called the inside line), is something like that
of throwing, and at his right side (outside line)
like that of whipping.</p>

<p class='c009'>Always keep in front of your opponent, never
more to your right or left; should he do so, keep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>on your own ground, turning only so much as to
enable you to have your right toes pointed to his.
Let him move round as much as he likes: he will
only tire himself and gain no advantage.</p>

<p class='c009'>Keep the head and body erect and quiet in all
positions.<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c020'><sup>[5]</sup></a> If you lean forward on the attack, a
man much shorter than yourself can thrust you
through the head by simply retiring and straightening
his arm, while your attack would not reach
him. You also cannot recover quickly, as too
much weight is thrown upon the front leg.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f5'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r5'>5</a>. The advantages of this are fully and clearly shown
by that justly celebrated fencer, Captain G. Chapman, in
his “Sequel to Foil Practice.”</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Avoid remaining on the longe and getting to
close quarters, no true defence can be made when
in-fighting.</p>

<p class='c009'>If you remain on the longe, your adversary may
easily and without any danger step forward with
his left foot and seize the wrist of your sword arm
with his left hand.<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c020'><sup>[6]</sup></a> By always recovering to your
guard such a manœuvre is avoided, and, if attempted,
you may easily deliver a straight thrust
as he steps forward.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f6'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r6'>6</a>. Although this would not be permitted in a duel, a
man would not hesitate to do it in actual combat.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Another reason why you should always recover
to your guard after an attack is, if you remain on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>the longe and your adversary retires one step, you
cannot reach him; he has then the advantage of
position, and will be able to attack you, while you
can only act on the defensive.</p>

<p class='c009'>If you can hit your adversary without feinting,
do so, as it is more dangerous to make two motions
than one.</p>

<p class='c009'>Use judgment, study your opponent’s play, and
make no meaningless movements. An assault
ought not to last longer than ten minutes. After
that time, if you have fenced with energy and
vigour, you lose your quickness and get out of
form, and thereby contract slow and bad habits.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>EXERCISES.</h4>

<p class='c018'>The following exercises may be practised by two
advanced players. The hits and guards must be
made as correctly, smartly, and as rapidly in
succession as possible, taking it in turns to lead
off. Care being taken not to move the left feet,
and to strictly preserve the proper distance between
you.</p>

<p class='c009'>The following is an example of the way in
which they should be gone through:—</p>

<p class='c009'>We are both on guard, and in hitting distance.</p>

<p class='c009'>I say, “You lead off.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Head, head, under right arm.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>You then lead off at my head, which I guard
and return with a longe at yours.</p>

<p class='c009'>You recover, and guard your head, and then
with a longe hit under my right arm, I guard.</p>

<p class='c009'>We should then remain steady a few moments,
you on the longe hitting under my right arm, I
on guard defending my right side, to see if the
positions of the sword arms, feet, and bodies are
correct.</p>

<p class='c009'>This should invariably be done at the finish of
each exercise. It helps to keep you in form.</p>

<h5 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Another Example.</span></h5>

<p class='c018'>You say to me, “You lead off.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Feint head, and hit under right arm. Thrust
at breast. Head.</p>

<p class='c009'>I feint at your head, and cut under your right
arm, which you guard, and longeing, return with a
thrust at my breast.</p>

<p class='c009'>I recover and parry it, then, with a longe, cut
at your head. Both remain steady to see the
positions.</p>

<p class='c024'><em>1st Exercise.</em>—Head. Head. Head.</p>

<p class='c024'><em>2nd do.</em>—Head. Head. Under right arm.</p>

<p class='c024'><em>3rd do.</em>—Head. Head. Outside leg.</p>

<p class='c024'><em>4th do.</em>—Head. Head. Left breast.</p>

<p class='c024'><em>5th do.</em>—Head. Head. Inside leg.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span><em>6th do.</em>—Feint head, hit under right arm.
Thrust at breast. Head.</p>

<p class='c024'><em>7th do.</em>—Feint head, hit outside leg. Thrust at
breast. Head.</p>

<p class='c024'><em>8th do.</em>—Thrust straight at breast. Head. Hit
under right arm.</p>

<p class='c024'><em>9th do.</em>—Disengage with a thrust. Hit under right
arm. Head.</p>

<p class='c024'><em>10th do.</em>—Head. Head. Hit under right arm.
Thrust at breast. Head.</p>

<p class='c024'><em>11th do.</em>—Head. Head. Hit outside leg. Thrust
at breast. Head.</p>

<p class='c024'><em>12th do.</em>—Feint a thrust under the blade, and hit
at the head. Inside leg. Thrust at the
breast. Head. Head.</p>

<p class='c009'>In these exercises you must not get into the
habit of cutting only at each other’s swords, and
thereby making a mock combat, but you should
try to hit each other on every occasion.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>THE SALUTE.</h4>

<p class='c018'>The Salute is a ceremony usually performed by
two sabre players previous to making an assault.
It is a mark of respect to those looking on, and
an act of courtesy to each other.</p>

<p class='c009'>Both should move together, and keep correct
time throughout its performance.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>There is no established method, but the following
is that generally adopted by the best sabre players
I know.</p>

<p class='c009'>The two adversaries, facing each other in the
first position, without wearing masks, which should
be laid on the floor on their left, go smartly on
guard, as shown in Plate <a href='#II'>II</a>., and having beat twice
on each other’s blades, return to the first position.</p>

<p class='c009'>Both bring the hilt to the mouth, the point of
the thumb level with the lower lip, sword upright,
and edge to the left. This is called “Recover
swords.” Then turning the face and directing the
eyes to the left, slowly and gracefully extend the
arm and the sword in the same direction until the
point is level with the centre of the face and arm
nearly straight, hand in quarte, and as high as the
shoulder.</p>

<p class='c009'>After a short pause both again recover swords,
and, turning the face to the right, extend the hand
in a similar manner to the right. Hand in tierce.</p>

<p class='c009'>From there they recover swords, and, falling on
guard, beat a double attack with the right foot (a
beat with the heel and one with the flat of the foot
in rapid succession). Then, bringing the left foot
up to the right, recover swords, and lower the
hand and sword slowly towards the right hip.
Arm straight, palm down, and edge to the right.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>
  <h4 class='c016'>RULES.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>You must not attack until an engagement has
been formed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Touches on any part are counted good.</p>

<p class='c009'>You must not hit after you are touched, but
recover to the first position and acknowledge
the hit.</p>

<p class='c009'>After each hit, both men should go to their
original ground, and form a fresh engagement
before renewing the assault.</p>

<p class='c009'>When a man leads off with proper quickness,
the other should guard before returning. Should
he not do so, the hit belongs to the one who
led off.</p>

<p class='c009'>When two men lead off together and both hit,
neither hit is counted.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the Remise or Redouble and Return are
made together, the hit belongs to the one making
the Return.</p>

<p class='c009'>If the Stop Thrust is not made in sufficient time
to prevent the attack being delivered, the hit
counts to the one making the attack.</p>

<p class='c009'>A hit is counted good after a disarmament, if
given immediately after and before there is time
to think.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>
  <h4 class='c016'>DRESS FOR SABRE PLAY.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Although the figures in the preceding illustrations
are shown without masks or pads, no practice
ought ever to be made without them. The following
is the dress usually worn.</p>

<p class='c009'>A flannel shirt and trousers, shoes with soles of
buff leather, without heels.</p>

<p class='c009'>A stout leather jacket, arm guard, leather apron,
leg guard on right leg, and a pair of shoulder pads,
shaped like a milkman’s yoke.</p>

<p class='c009'>A strong helmet covered with leather on the
top, with large ear guards, and the mask of strong
wire with the meshes sufficiently small to prevent
the point of the sabre passing through. A leather
stock should also be worn round the neck.</p>

<p class='c009'>When practising with sticks, the shoulder pad
and arm guard may be dispensed with, and the
hand ought to be protected with a buffalo hide
hand guard.</p>

<p class='c009'>Basket hilts are dangerous, as the point of the
stick is apt to pass through them, and your hand
may thereby be seriously injured.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>PRACTICE SABRE.</h4>

<p class='c018'>The practice sabre should have a quill edge, which
is the bluntest edge there is, and the point should
be rounded off.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>SABRE <em>v.</em> BAYONET.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>While writing on this subject, the fencing names
of the parries will be used, viz.:—</p>

  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c009'>In describing how to deal with a man armed
with a rifle and bayonet, it will be necessary to
explain his methods of attack and defence.</p>

<p class='c009'>A bayonet should be used like a foil, but in consequence
of its weight and general unwieldiness,
the simple movements of the latter weapon can
only be executed by it, and as the sabre, from its
weight and shape, is similarly circumstanced, the
two arms, in that respect, are on equal terms.</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>A bayoneteer, therefore, engages in tierce or
quarte, from which he can make the following
attacks:—</p>

<p class='c009'>A straight thrust.</p>

<p class='c009'>A disengagement.</p>

<p class='c009'>Feint a straight thrust and disengage.</p>

<p class='c009'>“One, Two” (feint a disengagement into one
line and disengage into another).</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>How to Parry his Straight Thrusts and Disengagements.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>All his straight thrusts or disengagements over
your blade may be parried with prime, and all
those under your blade with seconde.</p>

<p class='c009'>These parries are stronger than tierce and quarte,
and are, therefore, better adapted for parrying
such a heavy weapon as a rifle and bayonet.</p>

<p class='c009'>They also defend the head and leg as well as the
body, while the others only guard the breast.</p>

<p class='c009'>Tierce and quarte may, however, be occasionally
used against his thrusts at the breast. A greater
variety of returns would be thereby obtained.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>
  <h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>How to Parry, “Feint a Straight Thrust, and Disengage.”</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>His feint of a straight thrust, when engaged
under the blade and disengagement over the blade,
may be parried with seconde and prime.</p>

<p class='c009'>His feint of a straight thrust, when engaged over
the blade and disengagement under the blade, may
be parried with prime and seconde.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>How To Parry “One, Two.”</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>His “One, Two” below and above your blade
may be parried with seconde and prime, and his
“One, Two” above and below your blade with
prime and seconde.</p>

<p class='c009'>If he should deceive your quarte by feinting in
quarte and thrusting in tierce, parry tierce.</p>

<p class='c009'>If he deceive your tierce by “One, Two,” parry
seconde.</p>

<p class='c009'>Should you at any time foresee that he is
going to attack with “One, Two,” do not
answer the feint, but wait and parry his last
movement.</p>

<p class='c009'>Your parries, which should be made with the
edge of the forte of the sword, must be close, and
finished with firmness, without stiffness or too
much force.</p>

<p class='c018'>A man thus armed engages in quarte or tierce,

<p class='c018'>The bayoneteer has the longer weapon. You
have the handier one. You must therefore use
such tactics as will give it the advantage.</p>

<p class='c009'>On taking guard, keep out of distance, and by
feinting, endeavour to find out whether, if you
attack him, he will parry or counter with a thrust,
which some men, relying on the superior length
of the rifle and bayonet, do when attacked.</p>

<p class='c009'>If you think that the latter is his intention,
make false attacks, as described in page <a href='#Page_76'>76</a>, and
draw out his thrust, which, having guarded, return
with the greatest rapidity. A counter with a
bayonet must be avoided by every means possible.</p>

<p class='c009'>Should you see that he is disposed to guard,
you may attack him without much fear of a
counter.</p>

<p class='c009'>You should not attack too often, but rely more
upon your guard and quick return. When, however,
you do attack, use the feints very much.
Doing so gives the advantage to the handier
weapon.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>Your returns, in which the thrust should take a
prominent part, must be made with the greatest
rapidity, and the opposition in them, as in the
attacks, strictly maintained, so that he cannot
possibly deliver a remise thrust.</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>If you at any time have an opportunity of
parrying his thrusts with your left hand, or of
seizing the barrel of his rifle with it, do so. You
must not then struggle and try to get it out of
his hands, but must deliver a cut or thrust as
quickly as possible. In an actual combat you
would then have little difficulty in getting his
weapon should you want it.</p>

<p class='c009'>A good time to attempt this is when, after you
have parried prime, he does not recover quickly to
his guard. You should then step forward quickly
with the left foot, and, seizing the rifle, pull it
down and towards you, so that he cannot reverse
it to strike you with the butt.</p>

<p class='c018'>Or you may sometimes get hold of it after your
parry of quarte, when he is slow in recovering.
It will not then be necessary to step forward with
the left foot, as your parry will almost send his
weapon into your left hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>Some men when thrusting leave go of the rifle
with the left hand. When your adversary does
this and you get hold of it, a quick and sudden
pull will draw it out of his other hand, or perhaps
pull him on his knees.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Dress.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The dress should be the same as that worn when
practising with sabres, except that the man using

boxing glove on each hand.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>ON SWORDS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It will be useless for me to say anything about
the length and shape of swords, as in the British,
and, I believe, every other service, an officer,
whether he belong to the army, the navy, or the
reserve forces, is compelled to wear the regulation
sword of the corps he belongs to.</p>

<p class='c009'>He can, however, purchase it where he likes,
and has a certain amount of discretion in small
matters, which, if carefully attended to, may make
a most important difference in the utility of his
weapon. “Mony a mickle mak’ a muckle.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I would advise him by all means to get it from
a good sword cutler, and see the blade properly
proved—a very necessary precaution, as no bad
blade will stand so severe a test.</p>

<p class='c009'>He may then be sure that there is no flaw in it
or in the tang (the part that passes through the
grip).</p>

<p class='c009'>A flaw in either may cost you your life.</p>

<p class='c009'>The blade should be stiff and not whippy, as a
whippy blade meets with so much resistance from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>the air when cutting or guarding quickly, and the
point should be light, so that the sword will feel
well balanced in the hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>A whippy blade with a heavy point wrenches
the wrist and elbow joints, and is extremely
difficult to use. It altogether mars the proper use
of the weapon.</p>

<p class='c009'>The grip should suit your hand, and the steel
back should be roughened to prevent the sword
from turning in it.</p>

<p class='c009'>On service, the grip, if not too thick, may be
lapped with thin string slightly waxed; by this
means it may be altered to any shape you like,
and you will be able to hold the sword more
securely.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sword should be tightly mounted, that is,
the grip should not be loose, the blade well
shouldered up both back and front, so that there is
no space between the shoulder and the hilt, and
the end of the tang securely screwed and rivetted
at the pommel.</p>

<p class='c009'>To test the mounting, strike both the back and
edge of the blade several times sharply against a
post. If the grip then remains firm and tight
and the blade rings, it is a proof that the mounting
is fairly good. Should it, after being used some
time, become loose, have it put right at once.</p>

<p class='c009'>You cannot give an effective cut with a loosemounted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>sword. It stings your hand, and spoils
the general handling of the weapon.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>SCABBARD.</h3>

<p class='c018'>The scabbard should be lined with leather or
laths of wood, and the mouthpiece with German
silver, which is softer than steel, to preserve the
edge when drawing and returning the sword.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>EDGE.</h3>

<p class='c018'>Various edges are put on swords, but the best
and most serviceable one, in my opinion, is a short
chopper edge. It is the one put on swords used
for cutting bars of lead, carcases of sheep and legs
of mutton.</p>

<p class='c009'>The bone of a leg of mutton, which is almost as
hard as any substance the edge is likely to come in
contact with, will not turn it.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have now swords with this edge in my possession
with which hundreds of bars of lead, numerous
carcases of sheep and legs of mutton and other
substances have been cut, and the edges are still in
good condition and fit for use.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>
  <h3 class='c019'>SOME REMARKS CONCERNING SWORD HILTS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c018'>The shape of the grip in the regulation infantry
sword is not bad generally, but the metal back is
unnecessary, and is apt to cause the hand to slip.</p>

<p class='c009'>The grip of Japanese swords, but for the fact of
their having the curve presented the wrong way,
strikes me as exceedingly good.</p>

<p class='c009'>Were I having a fighting sword made to my
own fancy, without regard to the regulation of any
service, I should direct it to be made with a grip
of shark’s skin or leather, with a strong twist of
wire wound round at half-inch intervals, as in the
regulation pattern, but continued all the way round
without any metal back.</p>

<p class='c009'>The pommel should be considerably heavier than
is customary, and the shell (and I consider this the
most important thing) should be of a pattern differing
materially from that in common use.</p>

<p class='c009'>The present form of shell is carried out into a
tolerably bold curve on the outer side, no doubt
for the purpose of covering the knuckles and arm,
which, in a right-handed man, are exposed on this
side, while on the reverse side the shell does not
project to quite half the same extent.</p>

<p class='c009'>The consequence of this arrangement is that the
greater weight on the outside tends to throw over,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>I mean, to make the wrist rotate from left to right
as it does in attacks on the inner line, and to make
rotation correspondingly difficult on the outer line,
that is, from right to left.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now, it may be regarded as proved that attacks
on the inner line, although very effective, expose
the swordsman more than those delivered at the
outside of his adversary’s body, consequently the
tendency to which I have referred cannot but be
considered a vicious one. Again, it may happen
that the swordsman is disabled by a flesh wound
sufficiently grave to incapacitate his sword arm, but
not of such severity as to prevent his continuing in
action should he have learned to use his left. If
he then pass his sword into his left hand, he will
find that the shell, as at present formed, offers a
most inadequate protection to the hand and arm,
which would not be the case if the projections were
equal on both sides.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Scotch basket hilt, with some modifications,
so as to give freer play to hand and wrist, is not a
bad pattern.</p>

<p class='c009'>There should be little or no open work about
the shell: an unlucky thrust or cut with the point
might disable your hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>I would also recommend that that part of the
shell which comes into contact with the point of
the thumb where it rests on the back of the grip
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>should be lightly padded with a few thicknesses of
soft leather, so as to lessen the concussion, which
is sometimes of sufficient force to loosen your hold
of the sword grip, or at all events to impair that
nicety of touch upon which successful swordsmanship
in a high degree depends.</p>

<p class='c009'>Before leaving this subject, I should like to
remark that, although the grip of the regulation
sword is not so faulty as its shell, yet it appears to
me capable of improvement.</p>

<p class='c009'>The back of the grip is convex throughout its
length, an arrangement which, when the thumb is
pressed upon it, as it should be in the use of a
light sabre, does not give so good a hold as one
presenting in the lower part a concavity into
which shall fit the convex surface of the extended
thumb. I have in my possession a pair of practice
sabres made upon this principle, and also with a
squarer grip than is customary, which are delightful
to handle.</p>

</div>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>SWORD FEATS.</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c016'>PLATE XXX.<br /> <span class='c017'><span class='sc'>Lead Cutting.</span></span></h3>

<p class='c025'>To cut a bar of lead in two at one stroke.</p>

<p class='c009'>This feat is sometimes called the “Cœur de
Lion,” deriving its name from the feat said to have
been performed by Richard I. when he met Saladin
the Saracen at the station of the Diamond of
the Desert, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vide</span></i> Sir Walter Scott’s “Talisman.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It is one which every sabre-player ought to
practise more or less. It teaches how to apply
force and edge, and to finish your cuts with
quickness, by which they are more effective. It
also shows the power of a sword-cut when properly
delivered.</p>

<p class='c009'>The great secret of this, and most of the sword
feats, is a free delivery, true edge, and striking
the object with the part of the blade called the
centre of percussion with great velocity.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sword generally used for this purpose is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>something like a naval cutlass, but longer and
heavier.</p>

<p class='c009'>The best sized sword for a man of average
strength is one weighing 3¼ lbs., with a blade 1¾
inches wide and 31 inches long. The size and
weight, however, depend a great deal upon a man’s
strength. A weak man would cut better with a
smaller one, and a very powerful man would find
a larger one more suitable. It greatly rests on
the velocity you are able to give it.</p>

<p class='c009'>The bar of lead, which you can cast yourself if
you are provided with a melting pan and mould,
should be about 12 inches long and triangular
(equilateral) in shape with flat ends, so that you
can stand it on one end.</p>

<p class='c009'>It may be either suspended or stood on end on
the top of a table or stool; I prefer the latter way,
as it is not so steady when suspended.</p>

<p class='c009'>A three-legged stool about 4 feet high, for a
man of 5 feet 8 inches, with a level top 9 inches
square, will be found as handy as anything for
this purpose.</p>

<p class='c009'>Place the bar of lead so that your sword will
first strike the most acute angle (should the bar
be not quite equilateral), then put yourself in the
position of “guard,” with the toes of the right
foot in a line with the lead, and at such a distance
that when you deliver the cut you will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>strike it with the centre of percussion of your
sword.</p>

<p class='c009'>Having taken your distance, throw your hand
quickly back into the bend of the left arm or on
to the left shoulder to get an impetus, and keeping
both feet firm on the ground, deliver a horizontal
cut from left to right as rapidly as possible, using
the elbow and forearm freely, and throwing the
weight of the body into the cut. Arm straight
and point of the sword to your right front at the
finish of the cut.</p>

<p class='c009'>In cutting, the wrist should be well sunk, the
upper knuckles turned up, and a firm grip of the
sword maintained, particularly at the moment the
sword strikes the lead.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sword, with the edge leading, should not
be turned in the slightest degree, but kept on
a level line so that the cut will be perfectly
horizontal.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the lead is suspended, aim a little above,
and when standing, a little below the middle.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is dangerous for any one to stand on your
right when you are practising this feat, as the
pieces of lead sometimes fly to a considerable
distance, and with great force.</p>

<p class='c009'>A little tallow on your sword will show you
what part of the blade you cut with, and will also
slightly assist the cut.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>The lead may be cut in several other ways, viz.,
from right to left, but as the hand turns in this
cut, you must be careful to strike the bar before
this occurs.</p>

<p class='c009'>It may also be thrown up and cut while in the
air, or it may be placed on a trestle about 3 feet
high, and cut with a downward chop: the way
in which Cœur de Lion is said to have cut the
handle of a steel mace.</p>

<p class='c009'>A good practice is also to place the lead at the
distance your adversary would be from you were
you having an assault, and make attacks upon it, or
forming a guard, give the various returns in the
manner you would on a real opponent.</p>

<p class='c009'>In this practice the lead should be thin, say
3 inches in circumference, as the cuts must be
made without drawing the hand back, you therefore
do not get the same sweep and force as when
cutting in the manner first described.</p>

<p class='c009'>A bar of this size is quite thick enough for your
first practice in lead cutting. When you can cut
it well, and with ease and certainty, you may
try one a little thicker.</p>

<p class='c009'>You should not attempt to cut one that is too
large and above your power; you will only jar
your elbow and destroy your confidence.</p>

<p class='c009'>When you can cut a bar measuring 1½ inches on
each side, you may attempt to cut the carcase of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>sheep weighing 60 lbs. or a leg of mutton of
9 lbs., and when you can cut one measuring
2 inches on each side (6 inches in circumference),
you may try your hand on a 90 lb. sheep or a
14 lb. leg of mutton.</p>

<p class='c009'>In melting the lead, which should be pure and
unadulterated with any other metal, see that your
mould is dry, as the slightest damp will cause the
hot lead to spurt into your face.</p>

<p class='c009'>Before pouring it into the mould, clear the
surface of the dross which you will constantly find
on it.</p>

<p class='c018'>Get the carcase of a sheep dressed in the
ordinary way, as you see them hanging in a
butcher’s shop before they are cut up into joints.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suspend it on a gallows by the hind legs with
the belly towards you, then standing with your
right toes in a line with the spine of the sheep,
and so near that the centre of percussion of your
sword will reach the back bone, and aiming at the
part where the butcher separates the neck from
the loin, deliver your cut as at the lead.</p>

<p class='c009'>Take care to throw the point of your sword to
your right front as you finish the cut, or you will
leave part of the flank uncut.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>To Cut a Leg of Mutton in Two at One Stroke.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Hang a leg of mutton by the shank with the
bone side to your left, so that your sword will
strike it first, and aiming at the “pope’s eye,”
deliver your cut as at the lead.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>Be particularly careful to grasp your sword
tightly, or the bone, which is exceedingly hard, may
cause it to turn in your hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>This is rather a risky feat, for the reason that
you have so little space to cut at in order to make
a good section.</p>

<p class='c009'>If you cut too low you will find a second bone,
which will probably prevent your sword passing
through.</p>

<p class='c009'>If you cut too near the shank, it will be a bad
section.</p>

<p class='c009'>Before cutting at the “pope’s eye,” you may
cut a thin slice or two off the bottom.</p>

<p class='c009'>See that the shank bone has not been broken.
Butchers often break it. It would probably spoil
your cut.</p>

<p class='c009'>For this and the sheep use the lead-cutting
sword, and take care that the gallows is firm.</p>

ordinary broom handle on the glasses, so that the
ends will rest on the inside edges, each end projecting
about half an inch over the water.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>With your lead-cutter deliver a downward chop
with great suddenness and quickness, striking as
near the centre as possible.</p>

<p class='c009'>This feat may also be done with a thinner wand

thread on the edges of two sharp swords and
suspend the wand on them.</p>

  <h3 class='c019'><span class='sc'>To Cut a Silk Cushion in Two at One Stroke.</span></h3>

<p class='c018'>Hang a silk cushion, stuffed with feathers or
down, so high that the centre of it would be a few
inches higher than the top of your lead-cutting
stool, then, aiming at the most acute edge, deliver
as at the lead. On account of the inconvenience
caused by the escape of the feathers from the
cushion when cut, this feat has of late years been
left unperformed at public assaults-of-arms. The
last time I saw it executed was many years ago
by my esteemed friend, Mr. Alfred Shury, at that
time one of the best swordsmen in London.</p>

<p class='c009'>This and the following are the feats said to have

  <h3 class='c019'>PLATE XXXIII.<br /> <span class='c017'><span class='sc'>To Cut a Veil in Two at One Stroke.</span></span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Fold a veil neatly lengthways and lay it on the
edge of the sword, almost close to the hilt.</p>

<p class='c009'>Place your feet together, with your sword hand
resting on the bend of the left arm, the edge
of the sword turned up. Take two quick steps
to your front, beginning with the left foot, and
as you make the second, deliver an upward
cut with a good edge, throwing the point of the
sword high in the air, so that when the veil separates
the two parts will have some distance to fall.
A good effect will thus be produced.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the finish of this cut, as in the lead cutting
one, the arm should be brought straight.</p>

<p class='c009'>The feat may also be done with a cambric or a
silk handkerchief (the latter is very difficult), or
with a kid glove or ribbon.</p>

<p class='c009'>When ribbon (which should be very narrow) is
used, have three or four colours, about a yard
of each, and lay the whole on the sword at once.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>After cutting them once, take all the pieces and
cut them again. If they are thrown high they
will somewhat resemble the coloured fire falling
from a sky-rocket, and will have a very pretty
effect.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gauze is the best textile to practise with. Try
to cut a yard of it into as many pieces as possible,
always taking care to fold each piece lengthways
before placing it on the sword.</p>

<p class='c009'>When you can do this well, try something more
difficult.</p>

<p class='c009'>For this and the preceding feat you require
a special sword called a handkerchief cutter. It
should have the edge of and be kept as sharp as a
razor.</p>

<p class='c009'>The edge should be ground and set towards the
hand, and when sharpening or stropping it, you
should always rub from point to hilt.</p>

<p class='c009'>If you look through a very powerful magnifying
glass you will find the edge of a sword is serrated
like a saw, but not so regularly; therefore, by
having the teeth pointed towards the hilt, the edge
more readily lays hold of the veil.</p>

<p class='c009'>To understand this more clearly, take a common
saw, whose edge is set towards the point, and rub
your finger from handle to point. However hard
you may press, the teeth will not prick you. Rub
the other way and the effect will be very different.</p>

  <h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>To Cut a Sheet of Note-paper Unsupported.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Take a sheet of note-paper, and, half opening it,
place it on end on the lead-cutting stool, the acute
angle to your left, the opening to your right, and
with your handkerchief cutter deliver as at the
lead. This is not difficult.</p>

<p class='c009'>In this and the preceding feats the thumb should
be round the grip.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the following it will be better to lay it on the
back.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>To Cut an Orange While Falling.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Suspend an orange by a piece of thin thread
about four or five feet from the ground. Place
yourself with the right toes in a line with the
orange, then, with a very light touch of the sword
near to the point, cut the thread, and quickly
turning the hand, divide the orange as it falls.</p>

<p class='c009'>The thread may be cut from right to left and
the orange from left to right, or <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versâ</span></i>, whichever
you find the handier. In both ways the cuts
must be very small and close.</p>

<p class='c009'>For this and the following feats any light and
handy sword will do. It should not be very sharp
except close to the point, so that you can cut the
thread with ease, and thus cause the orange to fall
straight.</p>

<p>PLATE XXXIV.—CUTTING AN APPLE ON A MAN’S HAND.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>
  <h3 class='c019'>PLATE XXXIV.<br /> <span class='c017'><span class='sc'>To Cut an Apple in Two on a Man’s Hand Without Injuring Him.</span></span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c018'>This is called the “Napier Feat,” from the fact
that it was done on Sir Charles Napier’s hand
when in India by a native swordsman.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is very dangerous and difficult, and none but
those who have great command over a sword should
attempt it.</p>

<p class='c009'>The man who holds the apple should have good
nerve, and should keep his hand very steady. He
must raise the palm of his hand as much as possible,
and, keeping the four fingers close together,
bend them back. The thumb must also be pressed
back, and kept as far as possible from the forefinger.</p>

<p class='c009'>Place the apple on his palm, and standing so that
your sword will pass between his thumb and forefinger
and point in the same direction, deliver a
downward cut without the slightest draw and with
sufficient force and no more than will cut the apple.</p>

<p class='c009'>This is such a delicate and dangerous feat that
whenever I have to do it I practise on several
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>apples of the sort I intend to cut, so that I may
find out the exact force to apply. Apples differ so
much in toughness.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>To Cut an Apple in a Handkerchief Without Injuring the Latter.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Take a pocket-handkerchief and tie the four
corners together with a piece of string. Hang it
four or five feet from the ground, then put in the
apple so that it will rest exactly in the centre.</p>

<p class='c009'>Aiming under the apple, give an upward cut of
sufficient force to pass through. If you make the
slightest draw you will cut the handkerchief.</p>

<p class='c009'>When apples cannot be got, you may use
potatoes or thin-skinned turnips for this and the
preceding feat.</p>

<p class='c009'>When performing these feats, take great care
that no one is within reach of your sword, and see
that everything is properly placed and steady
before delivering your stroke.</p>

<p class='c009'>Do not chop or hack, but make the cuts with
neatness and freedom. Avoid all parade, and
always remember to grasp your sword so that the
middle knuckles are in a line with the edge of the
sword. This rule is imperative.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'><span class='large'>RULES OF</span><br /> DUELLING WITH SABRES.</h2>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>
  <h2 class='c005'><span class='small'>THE FOLLOWING ARE THE</span><br /> RULES OF DUELLING WITH SABRES,<br /> <span class='small'>TRANSLATED FROM “ESSAI SUR LE DUEL,”<br /> BY THE</span><br /> <span class='large'>COMTE DE CHATEAUVILLARD.</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c016'>CHAPTER VII.<br /> <span class='c017'><span class='sc'>Duel with Sabres.</span></span></h3>

<p class='c018'>1st.—Each combatant must have two seconds
for this sort of duel, and one of the two must
have a sabre. They must, if possible, get sabres
with curved blades for the two antagonists, as
being less fatal.</p>

<p class='c009'>2nd.—When arrived on the ground there must
be no discussion between the two combatants,
their seconds being their plenipotentiaries.</p>

<p class='c009'>3rd.—The seconds having agreed upon the
choice of the ground the most proper for the
combat—level and equal for the two opponents—must
mark the two places, the distance being calculated
as if the two opponents were both on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>longe and the points of the two sabres one foot
apart.</p>

<p class='c009'>4th.—The seconds, after having tossed for the
places, take their principals to the place given to
each by chance.</p>

<p class='c009'>5th.—Gloves with gauntlets are generally used
for this duel, but the seconds of the insulted party
(if belonging to the class spoken of in the 11th
sec. of the 1st chap.) can oblige the combatants
not to wear them. Nevertheless, every one is
entitled to wear an ordinary glove, or a pocket-handkerchief
round the hand, but the handkerchief
must not hang down.</p>

<p class='c009'>6th.—If the insulted party (if belonging to the
class spoken of in the 10th and 11th secs. of
the 1st chap.) wishes to wear a glove with a
gauntlet, his seconds must offer a similar one to
his opponent, and if the latter refuses it, the
insulted party may use his and the other wear
an ordinary glove or handkerchief.</p>

<p class='c009'>7th.—When the combatants are placed, the
seconds measure the blades, which must be of
equal length and similar shape. The choice of
the sabre, if similar ones are used, must be tossed
for. If by carelessness the sabres are not alike,
the choice should still be tossed for; but if the
sabres are too disproportioned for such a combat
it should certainly be put off.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>8th.—But, however, if the combatants belong
to the same regiment they can use their own
sabres, but the sabres must be mounted the same.</p>

<p class='c009'>9th.—The insulted party (if in the class of
11th sec., 1st chap.) can use a sabre belonging
to him, but he must offer a similar one to
his adversary, who can refuse it and then use his
own; nevertheless, if the difference should give
a too great disadvantage to either one or the
other the seconds should postpone the duel,
unless the seconds of both parties present a pair
of sabres unknown to the combatants. Then the
choice of the pair should belong to the insulted
party, and the choice of the sabre to the other.</p>

<p class='c009'>10th.—The seconds, after having invited the
combatants to take off their coats and waistcoats,
must go up to their principal’s opponent, who
must show his naked breast in order to prove
that he wears nothing to protect himself against
the edge or point of the sabre blade. His refusal
would be equivalent to a refusal to fight.</p>

<p class='c009'>11th.—When what is above described is
finished, the seconds should toss for which one
of them is to explain the conventions of the duel
to the combatants, to whom the weapons are then
given, with the recommendation to wait until the
signal is given to begin.</p>

<p class='c009'>12th.—When the seconds are placed on both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>sides of the combatants, the one designed gives
the signal by the word—<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Allez!</span></i></p>

<p class='c009'>13th.—If before the signal is given the combatants
join blades together it is equivalent to a
signal, but it is blamable if only one of the two
does it.</p>

<p class='c009'>14th.—When the signal is given the combatants
can cut and thrust at one another,
advance, retire, stoop, turn round, vault, and do
anything they think profitable to them: such are
the rules of the combat.</p>

<p class='c009'>15th.—It is against the rules of this combat
to strike your opponent when he is disarmed or
when he is on the ground, to take hold of his
arms or his body or to take hold of his weapon.</p>

<p class='c009'>16th.—Disarmed means when the sabre has
fallen out of the hand, or when dropping the
point has touched the ground.</p>

<p class='c009'>17th.—When one of the combatants is
wounded his seconds must stop the combat until
they think it proper that it should begin again.</p>

<p class='c009'>18th.—If before there is any wound one of the
seconds wishes to stop the duel, he asks if he can
do so to the opposing seconds by lifting up his
stick or sabre, and if an affirmative answer is
given by the same movement he suspends the
duel.</p>

<p class='c009'>19th.—The seconds can agree beforehand to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>stop the duel at the first blood shed—humanity
and the gravity of the case must guide them.</p>

<p class='c009'>20th.—If one of the two combatants is killed
or wounded against the rules of the duel, the
seconds must refer to the 20th and 21st art.
of the 4th chap.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Duel with Sabres without Thrusts.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>1st.—If possible sabres with blunt points must
be used for this duel.</p>

<p class='c009'>2nd.—Each combatant must have two seconds.</p>

<p class='c009'>3rd.—The seconds, after having agreed upon the
choice of the ground best fitted for the combat—level
and equal for the two opponents—must mark
the two places at the distance calculated as if the
opponents were both on the longe and the points
joining together.</p>

<p class='c009'>4th.—Either combatant can use gloves with
gauntlets provided the adversary has one too,
or that a similar one can be offered to him,
otherwise the difference must be levelled by the
seconds.</p>

<p class='c009'>5th.—The weapons must be alike and unknown
to the combatants, but if the combatants belong
to the same regiment they can use their own
sabres, provided they are of the same sort and
have the same mountings.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>6th.—The seconds, after having tossed for the
places, take their friends to the places which have
fallen to them.</p>

<p class='c009'>7th.—The seconds must toss for which of the
two antagonists is to choose his sabre.</p>

<p class='c009'>8th.—The second designed to give the signal
must explain to the combatants the conventions
of the duel, which are, that it is strictly forbidden
to make use of the points of the sabres, which
would be felony.</p>

<p class='c009'>9th.—The seconds invite their friend to strip
naked down to the waist, but they may keep
their braces on if they are used to them.</p>

<p class='c009'>10th.—The seconds present both sabres to the
combatant who has gained by toss the right to
choose, who picks one out, they then present the
last one to the other combatant and recommend
them both to wait for the signal.</p>

<p class='c009'>11th.—When the seconds are placed on both
sides of the combatants the signal is given by the
word—<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Allez!</span></i></p>

<p class='c009'>12th.—When the signal is given the combatants
can cut at one another—taking care not to wound
their adversary with the point of their sabre—can
stoop, advance, retire, turn round, vault, &amp;c., and
stop only when the seconds tell them to: such are
the rules of the combat.</p>

<p class='c009'>13th.—The seconds must always stop the duel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>as soon as one of the combatants is wounded, in
order to see whether he can continue or not—the
seconds are the only judges for that; but the
custom in this kind of duel is to stop the combat
at the first wound.</p>

<p class='c009'>14th.—If one of the combatants is killed or
wounded against the rules, <em>see</em> 20th and 21st art.
of 4th chapter.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Chapters</span> 1st–10th.—The insulted party has
the choice of the duel and weapons.</p>

<p class='c009'>11th.—The insulted party, if struck or wounded,
has the choice of the duel, weapons, distances,
and can forbid his opponent to use weapons
belonging to him, but in that case he must not
use his own.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Chapters</span> 4th–20th.—The seconds must, if anything
takes place against the rules, make a written
statement of it and prosecute the felon by all the
laws in their power (and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">poursuivre le fauteur
devant les tribunaux par toutes les voies de droit
en leur pouvoir</span></i>).</p>

<p class='c009'>21st.—The seconds of the party who is charged
with felony must, by all means, declare the truth.
They are not otherwise accountable for it, unless
they aided in committing the wrong, which cannot
be supposed possible.</p>
